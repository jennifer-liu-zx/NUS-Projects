## Overview
This project is done as part of NHS2061 Post-Conflict Cambodia from AY23/24 Semester 1 to Ay24/25 Semester 2.

## Task
Over a year, I completed an independent study on YouTube as a Carrier of Cultural Heritage in Cambodia. 
* In the first half of the project, I chose a research topic, conducted the literature review, and prepared a Research Proposal and an Inception Report.
* Over Summer, students spent 2 weeks in Cambodia, immersing ourselves in the culture while conducting primary research. Personally, I surveyed families and interviewed Cambodian YouTubers. Finally, I put the data collected together in the Final Report, suggesting ways that Cambodia can leverage the social platform to elevate the awareness and appreciation for Cambodian culture, especially among the youth.
