## Overview

This project is done as part of IT1244 Artificial Intelligence and Society in AY24/25 Semester 2.

## Data

The team was provided with hourly weather data along with the assignment outline. The data was sourced from [oikolab](https://weatherdownloader.oikolab.com/app). More information on the data can be found in the team report.

## Task

The team was tasked to predict relative humidity 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours in the future, using only data of other indicators from previous periods.

## Contributions

The team consisted of 4 members. I must say that my teammates were all super hardworking and cooperative. I was responsible for some of the data exploration and cleaning and mainly in charge of the LSTM model.
