# Overview

This project is done as part of IT1244 Artificial Intelligence and Society in AY24/25 Semester 2.

# Task

The team was provided with hourly weather data and tasked to predict relative humidity 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours in the future, using only data of other indicators from previous periods.

# Contributions

The team consisted of 4 students. I must say that my teammates were all super hardworking and cooperative. I was responsible for some of the data exploration and cleaning and mainly in charge of the LSTM model.

# Data

The data was provided along with the assignment. It was sourced from [oikolab](https://weatherdownloader.oikolab.com/app). More information on the data can be found in the team report.
