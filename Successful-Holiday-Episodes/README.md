## Overview

This project was done as part of DSA2101 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation.

## Data

The team was provided with data from the [TidyTuesday project on holiday-themed episodes](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2023/2023-12-19).
The data contains information on holiday TV episodes from IMDB. 

## Task

The team was tasked to create 3 visualisations surrounding a central question.

## Contributions

The team consisted of 5 people. I was working with my friends who were great teammates!
I contributed mostly to the first and third visualisations and helped out here and there for the write-ups.
